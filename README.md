# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - Project 4 - Feed-Reader-Testing

## Testing a web app with Jasmine
For this Udacity FEND project we were required to write passing tests against a provided RSS feed reader web app using the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework. The tests suites included checks for valid URLs, etc., and analyzing provided HTML/CSS/JavaScript in order to test for correct functioning of a slide-in sidebar navigation menu. 

## Running the application:
+ Download the directories and open the index.html in your browser.
+ The results of the test are located at the bottom of the index.html page.
+ Test suites are in /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
